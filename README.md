# Project-Caviar-Analysis
*Preliminary Analysis of Project Caviar Dataset*

Project Caviar: Project Caviar was a unique investigation that targeted a network of hashish and cocaine importers operating out of Montreal. The network was targeted between 1994 and 1996 by a tandem investigation uniting the Montreal Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other national and regional law-enforcement agencies from various countries.

This project aims to to apply:
1. Degree Centrality
2. Closeness Centrality
3. Betweeness Centrality
on the dataset to identify important nodes and thus glean insights on which nodes are the most important ones in the network.
